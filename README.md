# smallest_enclosing_circle
To find the smallest circle which encloses given n points  
problem.pdf explains the whole problem and solutions in a descriptive manner Credits: Prof. S. Baswana, CSE IIT Kanpur		 Course:CS345A  
LEDA folder contains all the essentials for using LEDA  
LedaSetupGuideUpdated.pdf contains step how to run cpp programs using LEDA  
input.txt output.txt are samples how input and output will look like. For given code input is given in command line  
generation.cpp takes an input n and generates n random points  
smallest_circle_bruteforce.cpp takes n points (format is same as in input.txt) and gives center and radius of the smallest enclosing circle using brute force method  
smallest_circle_randomized_incremental.cpp takes n points (format is same as in input.txt) and gives center and radius of the smallest enclosing circle using randomized incremental algorithm  
Experimental_running_time folder contains running time of two algorithms for different n
Report.pdf is the final summary of the two algorithms and their results
